    "Note: This CME is visible as a partial halo to the northwest following the front of the earlier CME, with a fainter shock front portion visible to the southwest in SOHO LASCO C2/C3 imagery. There is a data gap in STEREO A COR2 from 2024-03-22T18:23Z to 2024-03-23T03:23Z, after which the end of this event is seen for a few frames before exiting the field of view but it overlaps in coronagraphs with the previous CME. The possible source the slower developing dimming to the SSW of Active Region 3614 (N25E07) following the initial X1.1 class flare, EUV wave and deep northern dimming to the NE of this Active Region. Alternative source is the concurrent flare from Active Region 3615 (S14E15). This event likely with CME: 2024-03-23T01:25Z.\n",
